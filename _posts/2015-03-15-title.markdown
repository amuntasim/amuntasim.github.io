when we are working on rails, sometimes we may require this

Say, we have User model and we need to find out how many days he registered.
You can have lots of ways to find that as you are on Rails(some might have some problems though)

Here is just another way :)

{% highlight rails %}
	def registered
	  "Registered #{created_at.to_date - Date.today).to_i} days ago" 
	end
{% endhighlight %}
